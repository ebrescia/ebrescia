# about-me

I'm Erica Brescia, the Chief Operating Officer at GitHub. I'm also on the board of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and an operating partner at [X Factor Ventures](https://www.xfactor.ventures/), a seed fund that invests in female-founded companies (all investment partners are female founders themselves). I'm focused on building the home for all developers at GitHub, so not doing much active investing myself these days, but always try to help founders where I can. Prior to joining GitHub, I was the co-founder and COO of [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/) (acquired by VMware). 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericabrescia) if you'd like to connect.
